Building LLMs from scratch with examples in notebooks at varios steps.

1. Linear Algebra - Matrix, Vector and Tensor operations
2. Basic Calculus - Value and Derivative classes for backpropagation
3. Basic NN - Linear, Sigmoid, ReLU layers, training loop
4. Regression example - Boston House Price Dataset, includes Normalizer and MSE
5. Classification example - Iris Dataset, includes Softmax, OHE and NLL loss
6. Basic tokenization - BPE algorithm
